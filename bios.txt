5/2014: ISI

Jonathan May is delighted to return to ISI. Contrary to popular belief
he has not been asked to re-do his PhD (obtained in 2010) due to
"irregularities" but instead has joined the institute as a computer
scientist, working on machine translation and semantics with Kevin
Knight and Jerry Hobbs. Prior to this he was a research scientist at
Language Weaver (now SDL). Before moving to Los Angeles Jonathan
worked for BBN Technologies (now Raytheon), where he co-wrote his very
first paper with current ISI director Prem Natarajan. Jonathan
received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of
Pennsylvania. All readers of this biography are heartily encouraged to
stop by office 940 for a complimentary sparkling water and lively
discussion of translation, automata, semantics, telepathy, or other
subjects.

He, nor that affable familiar ghost	s
Upon the hours and times of your desire?	s
I took my heart to me ;	b
That no calm southern port can chain	b
Reserve their character with golden quill	s
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;	s
How do I weep, how do I pine	b
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,	s
But as the riper should by time decease,	s
And beloved, thy midnight pillow	b
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.	s
No lip the same soft smile ;	b
HOPE was but a timid friend ;	b
And many maiden gardens yet unset	s
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,	s
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;	s
And glorious is the gladsome rise	b
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,	s
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,	s
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:	s
As golden suns at night decline,	b
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?	s
And / were laid warmly under the gleaming	b
But dreams like this I cannot bear,	b
Or whether revolution be the same.	s
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:	s
Make but my name thy love, and love that still,	s
Green grass and dew-steeped flowers	b
Life's crimson current streamed.	b
Cold blows on my breast the Northwind's bitter	b
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.	s
Thy griefs may wound thy wrongs may tear,	b
I did not fear to die ;	b
And here the green leaves shed a glow,	b
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,	s
Within their city's rocky wall ;	b
'Well hast thou spoken, sweet, trustful	b
For it no form delivers to the heart	s
Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;	s
And thoughts in my soul were rushing,	b
Which shall above that idle rank remain	s
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.	s
Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'	s
Depart ! ye restless, wandering thoughts,	b
Lost to mortality.	b
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;	s
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.	s
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.	s
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?	s
That's for thyself to breed another thee,	s
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.	s
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,	s
O fearful meditation! where, alack,	s
But dark curls waved around his brow,	b
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,	s
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:	s
My saucy bark inferior far to his	s
When my love swears that she is made of truth	s
The wounded soldier laid his head	b
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,	s
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,	s
This sentient soul, this living breath	b
To those first feelings that were born with me,	b
Could quench thy wild despair.	b
Burn, then, little lamp ; glimmer straight and	b
From cliff to cliff, thro' rock and heath,	b
And drear the course that has been run,	b
That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,	s
Let Almedore in peace and battle gory	b
Yet though 'tis wretched now to languish,	b
The murmur of their boughs and leaves	b
Like velvet beneath us should lie !	b
But I swear by Heaven and the mighty sea	b
And she was waning fast away	b
Beside his early stricken dead ;	b
Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or	b
That I might see what the old world could say	s
All mute as death beyond the shrine	b
That dream was written long ago.	b
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed	s
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,	s
And do not drop in for an after-loss:	s
Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,	s
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,	s
Where nought but it may wander more.	b
OFTEN rebuked, yet always back returning	b
Expands its arch on high ;	b
Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.	s
Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.	s
With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;	s
To see his active child do deeds of youth,	s
Wild moor-sheep feeding everywhere.	b
Since mind at first in character was done!	s
Why did the pilot, too confiding,	b
For never, never more shall they encounter mine !	b
Then, only then, believe I	b
But you shall shine more bright in these contents	s
Which never heals with years.	b
The swifter soul is gone before,	b
She 's bright enough to be our guide	b
One summer afternoon ;	b
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;	s
It, and our senses like to fleeting suns.	b
ALL hushed and still within the house ;	b
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,	s
But the sea of deep eternity,	b
Our love was love from heaven :	b
At least we would not bring them down	b
His fierce beams struck my brow ;	b
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.	s
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;	s
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,	s
'Twas but the dust of thy drear abode ;	b
But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee	s
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,	s
' Not so. Here the world is chill,	b
Than when it hath my added praise beside!	s
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection	s
Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.	s
4 The long war closing in defeat	b
Had darkness once obscured their sun	b
Save sunshine and the breeze ?	b
And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'	s
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,	s
It is the star to every wandering bark,	s
And Douglas for our sovereign's gore	b
To tie up envy evermore enlarged:	s
Now fall'n asleep is the battle blast,	b
Or state itself confounded to decay;	s
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,	s
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,	s
LIE down and rest, the fight is done,	b
But what turns every gleaming eye	b
drear desert through.	b
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,	s
Their venomed fury, as they sit.	b
Enough to wave my daughter's hair,	b
A sheet of crimson sheen,	b
For all the day they view things unrespected;	s
So should that beauty which you hold in lease	s
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:	s
He breathes at last, when the valley is past,	b
Let him but copy what in you is writ,	s
Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;	s
Can we not woo back old delights ?	b
Our love was new and then but in the spring	s
And for that riches where is my deserving?	s
And stretched metre of an antique song:	s
Checks the frequent stream of joy?	b
Thy loved repose above ?	b

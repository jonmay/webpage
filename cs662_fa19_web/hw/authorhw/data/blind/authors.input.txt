He, nor that affable familiar ghost
Upon the hours and times of your desire?
I took my heart to me ;
That no calm southern port can chain
Reserve their character with golden quill
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
How do I weep, how do I pine
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
But as the riper should by time decease,
And beloved, thy midnight pillow
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
No lip the same soft smile ;
HOPE was but a timid friend ;
And many maiden gardens yet unset
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
And glorious is the gladsome rise
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
As golden suns at night decline,
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And / were laid warmly under the gleaming
But dreams like this I cannot bear,
Or whether revolution be the same.
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
Green grass and dew-steeped flowers
Life's crimson current streamed.
Cold blows on my breast the Northwind's bitter
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
Thy griefs may wound thy wrongs may tear,
I did not fear to die ;
And here the green leaves shed a glow,
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
Within their city's rocky wall ;
'Well hast thou spoken, sweet, trustful
For it no form delivers to the heart
Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
And thoughts in my soul were rushing,
Which shall above that idle rank remain
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'
Depart ! ye restless, wandering thoughts,
Lost to mortality.
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
That's for thyself to breed another thee,
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
O fearful meditation! where, alack,
But dark curls waved around his brow,
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
My saucy bark inferior far to his
When my love swears that she is made of truth
The wounded soldier laid his head
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
This sentient soul, this living breath
To those first feelings that were born with me,
Could quench thy wild despair.
Burn, then, little lamp ; glimmer straight and
From cliff to cliff, thro' rock and heath,
And drear the course that has been run,
That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,
Let Almedore in peace and battle gory
Yet though 'tis wretched now to languish,
The murmur of their boughs and leaves
Like velvet beneath us should lie !
But I swear by Heaven and the mighty sea
And she was waning fast away
Beside his early stricken dead ;
Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or
That I might see what the old world could say
All mute as death beyond the shrine
That dream was written long ago.
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
And do not drop in for an after-loss:
Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
Where nought but it may wander more.
OFTEN rebuked, yet always back returning
Expands its arch on high ;
Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.
With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;
To see his active child do deeds of youth,
Wild moor-sheep feeding everywhere.
Since mind at first in character was done!
Why did the pilot, too confiding,
For never, never more shall they encounter mine !
Then, only then, believe I
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Which never heals with years.
The swifter soul is gone before,
She 's bright enough to be our guide
One summer afternoon ;
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
It, and our senses like to fleeting suns.
ALL hushed and still within the house ;
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,
But the sea of deep eternity,
Our love was love from heaven :
At least we would not bring them down
His fierce beams struck my brow ;
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
'Twas but the dust of thy drear abode ;
But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
' Not so. Here the world is chill,
Than when it hath my added praise beside!
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.
4 The long war closing in defeat
Had darkness once obscured their sun
Save sunshine and the breeze ?
And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
It is the star to every wandering bark,
And Douglas for our sovereign's gore
To tie up envy evermore enlarged:
Now fall'n asleep is the battle blast,
Or state itself confounded to decay;
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
LIE down and rest, the fight is done,
But what turns every gleaming eye
drear desert through.
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
Their venomed fury, as they sit.
Enough to wave my daughter's hair,
A sheet of crimson sheen,
For all the day they view things unrespected;
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:
He breathes at last, when the valley is past,
Let him but copy what in you is writ,
Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
Can we not woo back old delights ?
Our love was new and then but in the spring
And for that riches where is my deserving?
And stretched metre of an antique song:
Checks the frequent stream of joy?
Thy loved repose above ?
